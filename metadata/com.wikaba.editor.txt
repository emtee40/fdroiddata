#if the app is going to be at the top of the list then get rid of the ugly title
Name:919 Editor
Auto Name:919 Text Editor
Summary:Text editor
Description:
View and edit code (even as root). Multi-tab, syntax-highlighting and more.

The upstream project (920 Text Editor) is now using resources from AOSP so it's
unlikely it will be updated. This fork builds off the last commit available from
F-Droid. This fork will consist of bug and crash fixes.

Currently, the only fix so far is a fix for a crash occurring on large screen
devices.
