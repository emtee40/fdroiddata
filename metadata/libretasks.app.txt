Summary:Trigger actions when certain events happen
Description:
A fork of Omnidroid, now maintained and with more features. LibreTasks will
allow you to set up certain triggers, such as plugging in your phone or missing
a call, and allow you to specify certain actions that are done when that trigger
occurs, such as sending a SMS or pausing your media.
