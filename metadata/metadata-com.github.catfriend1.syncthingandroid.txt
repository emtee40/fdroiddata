Auto Name:Syncthing-Fork (Catfriend1)
Summary:File synchronization
Description:
Syncthing replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something open,
trustworthy and decentralized. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to
choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party and how it's
transmitted over the Internet.
Major enhancements in this fork are:
- UI explains why syncthing is running or not running according to the run
conditions set in preferences.
- A welcome wizard guiding you through initial setup on first launch or if
mandatory prerequisites are missing like for example the storage permission.
- Run condition bugs are fixed.
- "Battery eater" problem is fixed.
- Android 8+ support is on it's way.
