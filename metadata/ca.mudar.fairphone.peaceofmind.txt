Summary:A flight-mode timer
Description:
We become more conscious of our phones as our lives become increasingly 
connected. Would you like to disconnect, if only for a moment? Your phone will 
go silent and disconnect from the world: no e-mail, no status updates, no SMS 
and no phone calls. Choose how long you wish to disconnect (up to 12 hours).

Originally developed by Kwame Corporation for Fairphone 1, Peace of Mind+ aims 
simply to bring this beautiful app to other devices, and for future 
Fairphone-owners patiently waiting to receive their phone!

App works without root, but from Android 4.2+ root access is needed to switch 
to flight mode. Without root access the app will switch the phone to silent mode 
only.
