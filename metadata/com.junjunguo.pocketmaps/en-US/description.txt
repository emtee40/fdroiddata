PocketMaps is a map viewer with navigation system.

Maps can be easily downloaded with this app. Thus, a complete offline navigation
is possible. Through the so-called geocoding places can be searched.

* The search requires an internet connection.
* A very limited offline search is also available.

With the sport tracking feature, routes can be recorded to graph data such as
speeds.
