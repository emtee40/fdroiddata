Summary:View the epg and stream live tv on you from your vdr
Description:
If you have a VDR at home reachable over the internet and own a mobile phone
running Android then you possibly find this program useful. Using it you can
view the epg and stream live tv on you device.

If you do not have a vdr, ignore this app, it is useless for you.

VDR-Manager has two parts:

- The Android application for the user interface - A VDR plugin to communicate
with. Standard SVDRP is not used because this leads to much more traffic.

Here the some features

* list the EPG filtered by time or channel
* show EPG details
* search EPG for some simple text
* list, modify, delete or (de)activate timers
* create timers from EPG events
* remote wakeup VDR host using HTTP requests
* live tv
.
