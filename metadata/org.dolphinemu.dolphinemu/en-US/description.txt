Dolphin is a Gamecube, Wii and Triforce (the arcade machine based on the
Gamecube) emulator which supports many extra features and abilities not present
on the original consoles. Gamecube and Wii compatibility is good - one can
expect "mainstream" titles to run; lesser known titles can be hit or miss.
Triforce compatibility is currently limited to a couple of games - others
require more of the Triforce-specific peripheral devices to be emulated.

Status: ALPHA. Note that newer versions require ARM64, which only some of the
newest devices have.
