Description: |-
    The crazy calculator. Once you get used to it, you will love it :-)

    Your data is protected (encrypted) if you use your own access code and
    password. In case you have a lot of data, make sure to save it to the device's
    Download area via the SAVTO function.

    The app requires some extra processing in the background (e.g. for loading and
    saving). Depending on your system settings, this might cause a few 'hickups'
    for the time being ...

    If it gets 'stuck' due to some cut-down:

    - First go to the device's settings, clear the app data, and try again.
    - If it still cannot load your data, then open a file manager, rename the
    'Download/dibdib' folder (e.g. to 'Download/dd_OLD'), and start the app
    a-fresh.
