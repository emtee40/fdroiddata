Summary:Calculates radiation doses and consequences after nuclear power accidents
Description:
Program to estimate the consequences of radioactive  pollution after a nuclear
power plant accident. The starting point is the measured radioactive
contamination of the air, as measured  when it reaches the affected area first.
From this, the radiation exposure from  direct radiation, soil radiation and
food intake is estimated. Then the risks are  analyzed and behavioral measures
are derived.
