AutoName: Slim
Summary: Minimalistic launcher
Description: |-
    This project was inspired by LessPhone by Aswin Mohan. A launcher
    I adopted when I descided to take on minimalism as a lifestyle choice. I
    purged from personal belongings to my digital space. For my phone, I also
    needed a less distraction solution also, hence '''''LessPhone.''''' I loved
    it, but it worked ''a little too much.''
