AutoName: Simple Protocol Player NG
Summary: Audio player for uncompressed PCM streams
Description: |-
    This media player plays uncompressed PCM data from a server over your local network.  This is meant to be used for streaming audio from a PC to your Android phone or tablet.  The focus has been latency and so all the options are intended for the user to be able to find a compromise between latency and quality.
    As a rule of thumb, a low sample rate + mono + 50 ms or less of buffer time are the settings that are generally used.

    Streaming from Ubuntu (or anything running PulseAudio):
    The following web page describes how to configure PulseAudio for use with this player.  http://kaytat.com/blog/?page_id=301

    Streaming from Windows:
    Download the server from the following link and run it locally : https://github.com/kaytat/SimpleProtocolServer
    The server has some options also to help tune the performance.
