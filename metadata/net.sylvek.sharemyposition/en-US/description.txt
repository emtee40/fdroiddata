A simple way of sharing your location via a widget. You can send a message
containing a link to a map of your current location via any standard registered
sharing application. For example, an SMS message.

The recipient is sent a link to a web page that displays the location on a
Google map, though the app itself uses OSM. (The source for the web service is
in the same repository as the client).

Anti-Feature:UpstreamNonFree - Newer versions of this app require Google Play
Services, so there will not be any further updates in our repos.
