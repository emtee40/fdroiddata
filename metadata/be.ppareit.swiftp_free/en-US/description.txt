This app can serve files over the internet but the most likely usage is to
access files from another computer without needing a cable.

The name Demo in the launcher just means that it corresponds to the free version
on Google. The app is fully featured so instead of buying the "Full" version as
a way of contributing you can donate via the Paypal link.
