Summary: Send almost all text notifications to a Jabber account or your Gotify server
Description: |
    Sometimes a new giant smartphone is too big for me at parties. It's nice to be able to redirect all my messages to a little old one. In an emergency you can at least answer your real friends via SMS. My app redirects almost everything to a Jabber account or to a Gotify server. It's a little everyday hack that I don't want to keep from the FOSS community.

    Hey! Do not build loops! It is a bad idea having the receiving jabber or gotify account on the same phone X-)
