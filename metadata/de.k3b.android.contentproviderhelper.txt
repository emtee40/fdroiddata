Auto Name:Content Provider Helper
Summary:Frontend to discover/view/query data of android content providers.
Description:
Forked from 
[https://github.com/jenzz/ContentProviderHelper jenzz-s ContentProviderHelper] 
which is not maintained anymore.

Android content-providers are similar to database-tables. 
They have a name (aka "content:" uri), 
columns and they can be queried similar to Sql.

Android uses 
[https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html content-providers]
as api to manage global accessable data (i.e. Images, Telephone-book, SMS, ...).

ContentProviderHelper is a frontend to query installed content-providers.

App permissions are set generously to provide maximum compatibility.
