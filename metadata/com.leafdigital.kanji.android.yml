AutoName: Kanji draw
Description: |-
    A simple application that lets you draw Japanese characters (kanji) using the
    touch screen. It is intended for Japanese language learners who might need to
    enter characters in order to look them up in a dictionary or enter them on a
    website.

    It identifies the character you have drawn using a special form of handwriting
    recognition. You can select the correct character from a list. After entering
    one or more characters, you can copy them into the clipboard as text for use in
    a dictionary.

    Note that this will NOT work - at all - if you don't know basically how to draw
    kanji. If you just draw something any old way that looks like it, it certainly
    won't be recognised. You have to draw characters basically the official way.

    Note: This is a fork of the original application from [https://github.com/quen/kanjirecog].

    The upstream project is no longer maintained, but this application is still
    very useful because none of the freely available Japanese input systems for
    Android support kanji recognition.
