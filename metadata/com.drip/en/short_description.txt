Menstrual cycle tracking helps you understand your cycle data and gives you insights into yourself and your body. Use drip to track your menstrual cycle and/or for fertility awareness. Unlike other menstrual cycle tracking apps, drip is open-source and leaves your data on your phone, meaning you are in control.
