TrackerControl allows users to monitor and control the widespread,
ongoing, hidden data collection in mobile apps about user behaviour ('tracking').

To detect tracking, TrackerControl checks all network traffic against the Disconnect blocklist.
This is the same list, that is used by the Firefox browser.
This reveals the companies behind tracking to users
and allows users to block tracking selectively.
This blocklist also allows to expose the purpose of tracking, such as analytics or advertising.

The app further aims to educate users about their legal rights under
current EU Data Protection Law (i.e. GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive)

Under the hood, TrackerControl uses Android's VPN functionality,
to analyse apps' network communications locally on the Android device.
This is accomplished through a local VPN server, through which all network communications
are passed, to enable the analysis by TrackerControl.
In other words,
no external VPN server is used, and hence
no network data leaves the user's device for the purposes of tracker analysis.
