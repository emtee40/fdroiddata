Summary:Port of TwelF CMTheme for many launchers.
Description:
TwelF is a Material Design inspired theme aiming to provide a consistent and minimalistic look to your device.
This theme only supports FLOSS apps icons. You can use [https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.xphnx.iconsubmit Turtl] for requesting icons. As determining if the icons 
requested are related to FLOSS apps is a tedious work, currently only F-droid hosted apps are supported.

Supported launchers:
- Trebuchet
- Kiss
- Nova
- Apex
- Holo
- Asus
- Adw 
- and many more
.
