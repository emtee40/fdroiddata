Summary: baresip SIP client
Description: |-
    This is very basic project implementing baresip [https://github.com/alfredh/baresip baresip] based SIP User Agent.

    Currently supports voice calls and messages with TLS transport, voicemail MWI, PCMU/PCMA and opus voice codecs, as well as ZRTP and (DTLS) SRTP media encapsulation.

    Motivated by need for secure SIP user agent for Android that does not depend on third party push notification services.
