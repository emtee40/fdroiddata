Quoting Stars is a tool developed by the FZI that lets you directly translate 
the specific light installation Silent Communications 2017 by Betty Rieckmann. 
Her installation follows the rules of a Morse alphabet. By focusing on a star 
while in "Live View", it will translate what the star has to tell you. 
This app has many features, not only will it show you which stars you have 
decoded, it will also give you information about the artist, and show you via 
"Star Map" which stars you individually picked out of the installation.

The app Quoting Stars was built to help the visitors of the artwork 
Silent Communications 2017 read the Morse code of the installation. 
The artwork itself was created by Betty Rieckmann and will be shown during an 
exhibition at the ZKM Zentrum f√ºr Kunst und Medien in 2017 and 2018 in
Karlsruhe. The FZI is not responsible for the quotes in the app.
