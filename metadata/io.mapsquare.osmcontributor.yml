AutoName: OSM Contributor
Summary: OpenStreetMap Contributor Mapping Tool
Description: |-
    The Openstreetmap Contributor app allows anyone to contribute to OSM. It enables
    those-who-know to easily manage a group of newbies as the contribution process
    is intuitive and easy. The App comes in three flavours: store (for the Android
    Store version), poi-storage (for MapSquare POI Databases), and template (for the
    osm.mapsquare.io tool for Mapping parties). Bring your MapParties to a whole new
    level!
