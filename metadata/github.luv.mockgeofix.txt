Summary:makes a real device support "geo fix" and "geo nmea" commands
Description:
MockGeoFix makes an android device support "geo fix" and "geo nmea" commands
(ie. compatible with the android emulator for the purposes of mocking location).

Just start the application, click "start" and telnet to the IP address of your
android device on the specified port (default 5554) and you can mock location
exactly the same as with the android emulator.

Handy for reusing higher-level mock location tools built for the android
emulator on real android devices!

NOTE: MockGeoFix mocks a GPS provider. It might happen your GPS stops working if
you don't stop MockGeoFix properly. Should that happen, just click "start" and
"stop" in MockGeoFix and it will unregister the mock GPS provider.
