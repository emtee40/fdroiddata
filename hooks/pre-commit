# In the default configuration, the checks E123, E133, E226, E241 and E242 are
# ignored because they are not rules unanimously accepted
# On top of those, we ignore:
# * E501: line too long (82 > 79 characters)
#   - Recommended for readability but not enforced
#   - Some lines are awkward to wrap around a char limit
# * W503: line break before binary operator
#   - It's quite new
#   - Quite pedantic
